**Convolutional Neural Network Model**
 CNN or ConvNet is a deep, feed-forward artificial neural network. It is a feed-forward neural networks are also called multi-layer perceptrons(MLPs), which are the quintessential deep learning models. The models are called "feed-forward" because information flows right through the model. There are no feedback connections in which outputs of the model are fed back into itself.
